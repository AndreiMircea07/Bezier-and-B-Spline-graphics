# Bezier-and-B-Spline-graphics

This is a project which ilustrates the theory of Bezier for representing curves using polygonal shapes. It is meant to draw soft surfaces given by a net of points in the 3D space. For now , it is only able to draw curves and compute their dervatives , but much more could be build on this start.
