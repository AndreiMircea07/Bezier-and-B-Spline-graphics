# Bezier-and-B-Spline-graphics

This is a project that illustrates the entire Bezier theory about polynomial curves generated by polygonal shapes.
Its objective is to draw smooth surfaces given by nets of points in the three-dimensional space.
For now, the only possible application is to draw parametrically calculated Bezier curves and to represent their derivatives and divisions, although much more can be achieved on this basis.
